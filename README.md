# JavaScript Quiz
***

## General Info
This is an assignment for my coding bootcamp. The assignment is to create a timed quiz about JavaScript that stores high scores.  The specifications that are required are:
* When the start button is clicked, a timer starts and the questions are revealed one at a time.
* When an incorrect answer is chosen, time is subtracted from the clock.
* When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.
* When the game is over, then the player can save their name.
